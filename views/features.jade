  h3 Fast
  p.lead 
    | LibRadar takes just several seconds to scan an app and report the list of third-party libraries used in it.
  h3 Accurate
  p.lead
    | LibRadar is trained with more than 1 million apps from Google Play, 
    | so it can identify virtually all popular libraries in any given Android app. 
  h3 Anti-Obfuscation
  p.lead
    | Many Android apps are obfuscated with tools such as ProGuard, which makes it difficult to recognize a library by its package names or class names. LibRadar is obfuscation-resilient since we use features that cannot be obfuscated, such as  statistics on Android APIs.
